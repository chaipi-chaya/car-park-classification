# car-park-classification
The CNN for classifying car in the parking lot using data set from this website http://cnrpark.it/.<br/>
I created only one file with MobileNet using tensorflow.<br/>
Ran on AWS got a model with accuracy 70%, with parameter around 4M. <br/>
If I have time I will find a way to increase the performance, may be other models or something else.<br/>
Then I will create restful api for the prediction model with flask.
