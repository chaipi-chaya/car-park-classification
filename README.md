# car-park-classification
The CNN for classifying car in the parking lot using data set from this website http://cnrpark.it/.<br/>
I create only one file with MobileNet using tensorflow.<br/>
Unfortunately, my laptop took long time to run, so I will try to imprement this on AWS cloud server.<br/>
Stay tune for further work. Thanks.
